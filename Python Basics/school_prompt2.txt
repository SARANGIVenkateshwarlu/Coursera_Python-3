"The 6 pillars of all ML models"
 
In 2017, I had no idea about ML. Now, AI/ML consumes my entire day. I consider myself a serious ML person. Here is my story of how I transitioned from a core mechanical engineering background.
 
2017: Graduated from IIT Madras with dual degree in Mechanical Engineering
 
2017: Joined MIT for a PhD in Mechanical Engineering
 
2017-19: Years 1-2 of PhD at MIT. Purely experimental work, zero ML 

2019: Decided to transition to ML
 
2019-21: Incorporated ML into the research + course-work + projects at MIT
 
2021: Built an AI + Robotics integrated self-cleaning solar panel
 
2021: Reached out by NASA for technology partnership 

2022: Defended PhD at MIT 

2022: Co-founded Vizuara AI Labs with Dr. Raj Abhijit Dandekar and Dr. Rajat Dandekar 

Now I am doing 5 things in AI
→ Learning AI
→ Conducting research
→ Publishing papers
→ Building AI products
→ Teaching AI 
 
I do spend a good amount of time in AI/ML - learning, research, building products, and teaching. 

Yet I realize that it is humanly impossible to keep track of every single thing happening in the AI space. 

But I realize that there is one thing constant and timeless: foundational knowledge. Foundational knowledge transcends time. 

It makes you so confident no matter what the noise around you sounds like. 

Irrespective of how much AI changes, these fundamentals remain the same: 
→ Linear Algebra, 
→ Calculus, 
→ Probability, 
→ Statistics, 
→ Optimization and 
→ Programming fundamentals. 

So does it mean that if you know these topics alone, you know AI? Absolutely not. 

If you have just the foundation, do you have a house? No. But you can't build a good house without a strong foundation. 

Consider ML to be that house atop the foundation of Calculus, Statistics, Linear Algebra, Probability, Optimization, and programming fundamentals.
 
From my experience, I have 3 realizations
 
1) The way traditional ML is taught is not correct for engineers. There should be tremendous emphasis on foundational knowledge.
 
2) I had the inner belief that I can make the transition to ML. Now I realize that students from any field can transition to ML. 
 
3) There should be a lot of emphasis on research. Instead of toy kaggle projects, focus strongly on research. 
 
Anything good in life happens at the end of hard work. Anything sustainable and long-term takes time to build.
 
If you want to become a serious ML engineer, build strong foundations first.
